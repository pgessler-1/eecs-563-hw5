The Change of Creon
	In all works of writing, there are characters who change. This fact can be seen throughout Greek literature, especially in Oedipus the King and Antigone. During the events of both Oedipus the King and Antigone, we see Creon go from a rational and responsible noble, to an irrational power-hungry king who is blind to the decisions he is making due to his ever-growing position of power. 
The play Oedipus the King starts with Oedipus addressing the people of Thebes as to how he will bring an end to the plague. We are then quickly introduced to Creon, the brother-in-law of Oedipus. Creon had been sent to see an oracle at Apollo’s temple to find the solution to their problem. Creon claims that they must find the murderer of the former king Laius. To find this murderer, Oedipus summons Teiresias, a blind prophet. This meeting ends in Oedipus accusing Creon of conspiracy to take hos power. In these accusations is where we see the first glimpse of Creon of being a voice of reason. He tries to reason with Oedipus and help him see the outrageous claims that he is making. “Just reason with yourself. First, why should anyone with my rank and privilege, Untroubled by responsibility, give all that up? […] I have no interest in treachery. […] I won’t be accused in secret without cause” (Oedipus the King, Love Translation, p. 57). This paints Creon as an advisor to Oedipus who looks for the rational choice in a situation. He does not want Oedipus’ power for himself. All he wants is for Thebes to survive the plague.
